# Midterm Portfolio

## Learning Objectives
### Import, manage, and clean data:
For my final project I am expecting to want to pull in supplementary information as I work through my analysis. I have some ideas about pulling in stats from the monster manual and comparing those to player character stats. My main dataset is large and has a lot of variables, so I will be making subsets as I work through the analysis. Some of the data is already split into different sets, so I will be pulling those bits of information together as well.

In my project so far, I have pulled in the main dataset and have manipulated it a few times to get it into a workable format for the graphical analysis I have compelted

### Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentation:
The goal of my project is all about exploratory analysis. There are plenty of variables I’d like to dive into to find trends. I’m anticipating a lot of 5 number summaries, bar charts, and histograms in my future.

In my project so far, I have generated some means and created a few bar charts for level range and ability scores. I plan on further exploring ability scores to show the distribution of the scores and add some more complexity to the bar charts. I will expand on the numerical summaries.

### Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments:
I’m considering developing a tool to create randomized characters based on this data. I’d likely do it for each of the classes. I don’t know how difficult that would be, but if it’s looking like it will be too much I will supplement this objective with class activities.

I am stil exploring what to do with this objective

### Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs:
I’m not sure how I should go about demonstrating my use of source documentation for troubleshooting R programs. I can assure you that much of my coding involves googling issues as I run into them.
As I’m running my project analysis  I’m sure I will come up with ideas for functions and I run into issues or tasks I want to do repetitively. I’ll have to do more research into what external packages I want to use, most likely I will grab something to add more interest to my graphics.

### Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs:
All of my work that I present to you should be an example of this objective. I'm making sure to put comments throughout my work

## Growth
For each of the learning objectives I will add some description of what I struggled with and how I’ve overcome issues, or just write a section detailing overall what I've learned.

## Lightning Round: [These questions will be answered in the final portfolio]
* What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.
### I'm not used to having self driven projects. I'm used to being given very direct tasks. It was difficult for me to assess how much work I should be doing for the project. Coming up with goals for myself was harder than I expected. I do appreciate the ability to pick a topic I'm interested in and use creativity for how I address the course objectives.
* What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why
### I've learned other coding languages, so learning this one hasn't been too difficult. The graphical analysis and numerical summaries portion came especially easy to me, since I've done similar coding in SAS.
* What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.
### I used to hate R, but then I learned I was just being prejudice and I only didn't like it because it was different. Now that I've gotten to know R, I appreciate it. There are aspects to it I like more than SAS. 
* Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.
### Google is now your best friend.
