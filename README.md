# Midterm Portfolio

## Learning Objectives
### Import, manage, and clean data:
For my final project I am expecting to want to pull in supplementary information as I work through my analysis. I have some ideas about pulling in stats from the monster manual and comparing those to player character stats. My main dataset is large and has a lot of variables, so I will be making subsets as I work through the analysis. Some of the data is already split into different sets, so I will be pulling those bits of information together as well.

### Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentation:
The goal of my project is all about exploratory analysis. There are plenty of variables I’d like to dive into to find trends. I’m anticipating a lot of 5 number summaries, bar charts, and histograms in my future.

### Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments:
I’m considering developing a tool to create randomized characters based on this data. I’d likely do it for each of the classes. I don’t know how difficult that would be, but if it’s looking like it will be too much I will supplement this objective with class activities.

### Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs:
I’m not sure how I should go about demonstrating my use of source documentation for troubleshooting R programs. I can assure you that much of my coding involves googling issues as I run into them.
As I’m running my project analysis  I’m sure I will come up with ideas for functions and I run into issues or tasks I want to do repetitively. I’ll have to do more research into what external packages I want to use, most likely I will grab something to add more interest to my graphics.

### Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs:
All of my work that I present to you should be an example of this objective.


## Growth
For each of the learning objectives I will add some description of what I struggled with and how I’ve overcome issues, or just write a section detailing overall what I've learned.

## Lightning Round: [These questions will be answered in the final portfolio]
* What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.
* What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why
* What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.
* Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.
