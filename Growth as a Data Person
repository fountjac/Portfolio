# Growth as a Data Person

Before this class I was a SAS purist; SAS had been my main coding tool for several years and I didn’t understand or feel the need to learn other tools. I was reluctant to learn R, and at first glance it looked way more complicated to me than SAS. However, from my experience searching for jobs I knew R was a skill many companies desired in their candidates. I begrudgingly signed up for this class expecting that I would be longing to return to SAS the entire time. I tried my best to keep an open mind though, and fortunately I’ve developed an appreciation for R. 

There are three major things I’ve learned and grown to appreciate about R. The first being connectivity and documentation. In conjunction with GitHub, it is a lot easier to pull in data to R, and it's exciting to explore what other people have done on GitHub and branching my own path. Collaborating with others can be made a lot easier with this system. Using GitHub and R my documentation has improved substantially. I like committing updates and leaving comments, so I know what I changed when I come back to my projects later.
	
 The second aspect of R I really enjoy is its graphics . I feel like I have more control over my graphics and better options in R than I did coding in SAS. Personally I am a big fan of pretty graphs, and it can be both an impressive and important skill to have in the workplace. I’m still working on developing this skill further, but I’ve seen R’s potential and I want to keep learning how to build better and better graphics.

The third aspect is flexibility and the overall workflow of R. I’m starting to understand manipulating and transposing data better. I really like how pipes work; especially how it gives coding in R a modular feel. It was a struggle to learn how to build code like this at first, but now that I’ve gotten more comfortable with it I find it appealing.
