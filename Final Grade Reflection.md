# Final Grade Reflection

## What Grade Did You Earn? State it clearly in one sentence. You can include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.
I'm giving myself a solid B.




## How Did You Demonstrate That Grade? 
### Import, manage, and clean data:
My main dataset is large and has a lot of variables, so I will be making subsets as I work through the analysis.
Some of the data is already split into different sets, so I will be pulling those bits of information together as well.
Throughout this project I have had to manipulate the data several times to get it into a workable format.

Importing: Line 17, very simple example of importing data. 

Managing: Line 46-58, I used mutation and pivoting to get the date in a format I could work with

### Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentation:
Bar Charts for level and level range distribution: Line 32-67 for level range I worked a bit more on making the graph look nice with labels and a theme
Five Number Summary for each ability score: Line 69-77

### Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments:
Short code to sample 10 random level 1 characters: Line 

### Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs:
Throughout this project Google has been my best friend. We've had a long friendship through other coding classes and I've applied the troubleshooting skills I've learned from coding in SAS to coding in R. I usually find my solution by searching the problem in Google, reading through examples of other people's code and figuring out how I need to change my code to accomplish what their code is demonstrating. 

To extend R programs I've loaded tidyverse.

### Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs:
The other examples throughout the portfolio should demonstrate this. My code has short and neccessary comments aiming to ensure others can tell what my code is accomplishing.





## What Else? There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that is not explictly listed in the syllabus. 
If so, state the criteria you’re thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain
how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus course objectives, be focused,
specific, and thorough — and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.
