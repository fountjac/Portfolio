# Final Grade Reflection

## What Grade Did You Earn? State it clearly in one sentence. You can include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.
I'm giving myself a solid B.




## How Did You Demonstrate That Grade? 
### Import, manage, and clean data:
For my final project I am expecting to want to pull in supplementary information as I work through my analysis. 
I have some ideas about pulling in stats from the monster manual and comparing those to player character stats. 
My main dataset is large and has a lot of variables, so I will be making subsets as I work through the analysis.
Some of the data is already split into different sets, so I will be pulling those bits of information together as well.

In my project so far, I have pulled in the main dataset and have manipulated it a few times to get it into a workable
format for the graphical analysis I have completed.

### Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentation:
The goal of my project is all about exploratory analysis. There are plenty of variables I’d like to dive into to find trends.
I’m anticipating a lot of 5 number summaries, bar charts, and histograms in my future.

In my project so far, I have generated some means and created a few bar charts for level range and ability scores. I plan on further
exploring ability scores to show the distribution of the scores and add some more complexity to the bar charts. I will expand on the numerical summaries.

### Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments:
I’m considering developing a tool to create randomized characters based on this data. I’d likely do it for each of the classes. 
I don’t know how difficult that would be, but if it’s looking like it will be too much I will supplement this objective with class activities.

I am stil exploring what to do with this objective

### Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs:
I’m not sure how I should go about demonstrating my use of source documentation for troubleshooting R programs. I can assure you that much of my coding involves googling issues as I run into them.
As I’m running my project analysis  I’m sure I will come up with ideas for functions and I run into issues or tasks I want to do repetitively. I’ll have to do more research into what external packages I want to use, most likely I will grab something to add more interest to my graphics.

### Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs:
All of my work that I present to you should be an example of this objective. I'm making sure to put comments throughout my work





## What Else? There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that is not explictly listed in the syllabus. 
If so, state the criteria you’re thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain
how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus course objectives, be focused,
specific, and thorough — and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.
