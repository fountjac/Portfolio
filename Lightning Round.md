# Lightning Round
### *What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.*
I'm not used to having self driven projects. I'm used to being given very direct tasks. It was difficult for me to assess how much work I should
be doing for the project. Coming up with goals for myself was harder than I expected. I do appreciate the ability to pick a topic I'm interested in 
and use creativity for how I address the course objectives.

### *What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why*
I've learned other coding languages, so learning this one hasn't been too difficult. The graphical analysis and numerical summaries portion 
came especially easy to me, since I've done similar coding in SAS.

### *What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.*
 I used to hate R, but then I learned I was just being prejudice and I only didn't like it because it was different. 
 Now that I've gotten to know R, I appreciate it. There are aspects to it I like more than SAS. 

### *Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.*
Google is your best friend. If you get stuck trying to figure out how to code something ask Google.
